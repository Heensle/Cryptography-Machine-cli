After displaying both the frequency of letters in the English language and in the code, you may attempt to decode the message. Guesses must be fed to the comoputer in this form: 'letterInCode-letterGuess'. For example, if the letter X was present very frequently in my code, and I wanted to guess it is E, I would type in 'X-E'. This guess would then display in a 'decrypted' version of the code.
