Cryptography Machine
====================

An interactive cipher machine on the command line.

It was a school assignment. I was asked to create a code that has 3 cipher functionalities, but once I realized I could give them personalities, I was already too far gone. I've done my best to make the input systems foolproof, and make the code as cohesive as possible. 

Concepts I learned on this project:
  -.cpp and .h files and how to link them
  -interactions between functions
  -when you should use a namespace and when you should use certain functions of a namespace
  -the .cpp and .h files were a big one so they're on here again
  -how to divide code up amongst functions
